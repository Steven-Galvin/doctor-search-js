As of writing this README, these instructions work on MacOS.

There's some terminal commands you will need to run to get the app to launch locally on your machine. First though, you will need to clone this repository to your machine and navigate to its folder in your terminal.

Once you have navigated to the correct directory, you will run the following commands:

---A note before you run these commands. You will need to add your own '.env' file containing your own API key. If you don't have a key already, you can sign up on https://developer.betterdoctor.com/ and get your key for free!---

* $bower init
* $npm init
* $bower install
* $npm install
* $gulp serve

The required packages take a couple minutes to download and install due to the speed of your machine and your Internet connection. The last command should launch the app in your browser! That's it!
